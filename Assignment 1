question:

Make a python file, name it ass1.py. This file should have a definition of a class named MathTools with a member variable total_calls and two functions derivative and gradient.
- total_calls: records the total number of times either of the functions were called.
- derivative: takes a function and a number as its arguments (interestingly one function can accept another function as its parameter) and returns the approximate value of the derivative of the function at that number.
- gradient: similar to above, but this time it takes a function and a list of numbers (a point in space) as its arguments and returns the approximate gradient of the function at that point as a list.


## Solution

from ass1 import MathTools

def testForDerivative(x):
    return x**2+2*x+3

def testForGradient(W):
    N = len(W)
    value = 0
    for i in range(N // 2):
        value += W[i] * W[N - i - 1]
    return value

tool = MathTools()
